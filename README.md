# Mobile Application for Interactive Graphical Bird Identification

Birdwatching is a hobby growing in popularity which also has implications regarding the
monitoring of the health of our natural ecosystem. While paperback field guides and mobile
applications do exist to help new birdwatchers gain more confidence and knowledge in
identifying one of the hundreds of Irish species, many of these lack a way for beginners to
quickly and intuitively identify a bird they have seen in the wild, where a fleeting glimpse may
be all that they see.

This project aims to streamline the bird identification process for novice birdwatchers,
helping determine and learn information about unfamiliar species. Bird ID is a mobile
application that allows its users to narrow down the general shape of the bird and fill in a
number of colours on specific body parts, with a minimal number of clicks. The user is then
presented with pictures and information about the bird or birds that match their input, if any
matches are made. The user can also take part in informal learning by perusing and
searching through the list of birds identifiable by the app, in line with more of a typical
physical field guide.

The app successfully identifies and provides information on 11 distinct Irish bird species.
